## files for accessing transcriptomics data
clue_cellinfo_beta.txt: Metadata for each cell line that was used in the experiments
clue_compoundinfo_beta.txt: Metadata for each perturbagen that was used in the experiments
clue_geneinfo_beta.txt: Metadata for each measured feature / gene (metadata for rows of the data matrices)
clue_siginfo_beta.txt: Metadata for each signature in the Level 5 matrix (metadata for the columns 
	in the Level 5 data matrix)

## notebooks for looking at data
gene_expression_data.ipynb: looking at which compounds/transcriptomic profiles that exist and if we have enough data 
	to perform deep learning.
testing_GCTX_extract.ipynb: testing the various methods to extract specific transcriptomic profiles from GCTX files
